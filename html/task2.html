        <h1>Food Securitty</h1>
        <p>According to the United Nations Committee on World Food Security, food security is defined as meaning that all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life. The availability of food irrespective of class, gender or region is another element of food security. There is evidence of food security being a concern many thousands of years ago, with central authorities in ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 World Food Conference, the term "food security" was defined with an emphasis on supply; food security is defined as the "availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices</p>
        <p>Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The first World Food Summit, held in 1996, stated that food security "exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Similarly, household food security is considered to exist when all members, at all times, have access to enough food for an active, healthy life.</p>

        <h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
        <p> In this chapter, i will be discussin on some of the issues bordering on the sustainable agriculture and food production 
            globally. </p>
        <p> There are numerous factors to be considered to achieve a sustainable ecosysytem in food and agricultural 
            development as well as factors mitigating  global interest and awarenes in global agricucultural practices.
        </p>

            <h2>POPULATION GROWTH CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>Increased birth rate and declining death rates has opened up a teeming population challenge
                With improved health care birth mortality rate keeps reducing and even death rate among the aged
                is in check
            </p>
            <p>This contributes to the overall global population which is tending towards the 8 billion mark.
                Hence the need to increase capacity to feed the exploding world population
            </p>

            <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
            <p>Owing to Greenhouse gas Carbon emission there has been concerns of the depletion of he ozone layer
                thus reducing the protective cloud cover from the dangerous solar Radiation. this has led to erratic

                climate changes with extreme temperature rises, also leading to Polar ice melting.</p>
            <p>These climatic changes has somehow made seasonal farming unpredictable, farm flooding and sun
                scorching
                of crops. insulficient metereological data has also made weather forecast unpredictable</p>

            <h2>FOOD SAFETY</h2>
            <p>
                Ability to traced how safely foods has been moved from the farm and how well it has been handled via the
                <br>
                supply chain is of rising major concern
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus the need to train every personnel on the correct handling of food from production to the point of
                delivery
                And the correct labelling and record keepingof all activities such as proctective sprays etc
            </p>

            <p>Colgate also uses a torture test approach in this ad by visualizing the woman's enamel strength.
                The ad is simplified down to visual, product shot, and power claim. Notice that the background,
